            Yellow submarine is a virtual reality immersive experience in which a player 
            swims in an underwater environment with the goal of identifying eight different 
            types of fish, 2 of which are nearly extinct. Aside from this goal, players are 
            encouraged to explore the underwater world and enjoy the warmth, tranquility and 
            calmness it brings. The purpose of this project is to provide an opportunity for 
            people who can not snorkel or dive in the ocean, for various reasons such as disabilities, 
            restricted location, and or mental blocks/fear, to experience this unique activity via virtual 
            reality. Also, by integrating nearly extinct species, our project encourages players to look 
            more closely at how they as individuals may be impacting the health and wellbeing of the oceans 
            and in particular of other coexisting living organisms. Overall, it educates players 
            and expands on previous understandings about just how diverse, complex and beautiful life on Earth is.
