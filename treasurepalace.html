            Treasure Palace is a gaming system in which the user interacts, 
            takes action, and responds to a Processing sketch that visually 
            displays the game interface on a computer. The theme of the game 
            follows a pirate who scavenges for treasure on an island in the 
            middle of the sea with the ultimate goal of finding as many diamonds, 
            rubies and emeralds as possible after 10 rolls of the dice. The purpose 
            of the game is to allow people of all ages to relax in times of stress 
            and increase creativity, problem-solving skills and emotional wellbeing.
