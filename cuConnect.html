    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <div class="flex-container2">
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> CU Connect is an app that enables college students to easily connect with classmates directly. 
            This app aims to encourage and assist students in making new connections and in growing their 
            social network while in college and throughout the rest of their career.
        </p>
        <div class="flex-container2" style="width:50%;"> 
            <p><strong>Target Audience:</strong> Current college students</p>
            <p><strong>Timeline:</strong> 2 Months</p>
            <p><strong>Role:</strong> Co-led entire design process from empathize to test to final product</p>
            <p><strong>Software:</strong> Figma</p>

    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>The overall wellbeing and mental health of college students is steadily declining to record lows. Rates of stress, anxiety and depression
         are high among university students. As our society becomes more dependent and attached to technology, social interactions become less 
         frequent and many report feelings of isolation and loneliness. Following the 2020 pandemic, the ability to have interactions was next to 
         impossible making the mental health crisis even worse. After the state of emergency was lifted, the idea of having conversations and being 
         confident enough to meet new people brought uncertainty and additional stress. Since sharing ideas, collaborating and problem solving in 
         groups has proven to be effective ingredients for a successful college career, this problem needs to be addressed.
    </p>
    <h2>The Solution</h2>
    <p>Our app alleviates negative thoughts and feelings of doubt brought up when meeting new people by providing students the means to plant a conversational
         seed with fellow classmates through a direct messaging platform. In this platform, students have the ability to form group messages for increased 
         collaboration and support. As an addition, information about campus clubs and events is included to increase involvement and opportunities for students 
         to create new connections.
    </p>
    <h2>User Research</h2>
    <p>In addition to reflecting and documenting our own thoughts and actions about social connectedness as we were current college students during this project, 
        we conducted interviews with 4 other current college students on the University of Colorado Boulder campus.
    </p>
    <p>
        The interview consisted of 10 total questions:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>What organized groups or clubs do you consider yourself a member of if any?</li>
        <li>What apps or methods, if any, do you use to form study groups at CU?</li>
        <li>Are there any aspects of social media apps that you currently use that you feel works well or that you like?</li>
        <li>What design aesthetics do you appreciate when using an app or website?</li>
        <li>What kinds of CU reminders or resources do you access frequently from your cell phone if any?</li>
        <li>What do you think is currently lacking in the CU communications networks? (ex. Canvas, CU emails, etc.)</li>
        <li>What information about clubs or groups do you think would be helpful for you to have access to?</li>
        <li>What frustrates you about the process of finding information about campus events and clubs if anything?</li>
        <li>What do you feel has been the hardest in terms of social connectedness while at college within the past couple of years amidst the pandemic?</li>
        <li>Why do you feel it is important, or not important, to connect with other members of the CU community?</li>
    </ol>
    <p>We took detailed responses and organized the data into an affinity diagram:</p>

    <p><strong>Insights:</strong></p>
    <p>After conducting the interviews, we were able to formulate the main pain points in the social life of a college student.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Intimidation, self-doubt and low self confidence prevents many from introducing themselves in person to fellow classmates.</li>
        <li>Information about ways for students to get involved in clubs or other events on campus is lacking and hard to find.</li>
        <li>There is no platform put in place for students to easily reach out to one another.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We were also able to conclude what students would like to see and what they would expect from a college specific social platform.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ability to easily find, contact, and create group messages with multiple class members.</li>
        <li>Posted information about events and clubs including calendars and reminders.</li>
        <li>An interface that is intuitive, simplistic and cohisive.</li>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>This was my first end to end UX/UI project. It was challenging at times but very rewarding in the end as I learned 
        a lot from the process. Since I came in with solid time management and problem solving skills as an engineer, I was 
        able to excel as a beginner where others struggled.
    </p>
    <p>
        Main learning points:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The design process is cyclical. You often have to go back to previous steps if what you have built does not solve the problem.</li>
        <li>Perform user testing more than once at different stages to make sure you are on track and meeting your goals.</li>
        <li>Your first idea isn’t always the best idea. Take the time to brainstorm. Don’t rule out crazy ideas early.
        <li>Focusing on little details like making sure everything is aligned and sized perfectly during wireframing and 
            prototyping is not necessary. Leave it for the final iterations.</li>
        <li>Believe and be confident in your ideas.</li>
            
    </ul>
