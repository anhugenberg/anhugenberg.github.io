            Taking on the role of a synesthete, this abstract animation links sounds to visuals giving a 
            glimpse into what one may experience by have such abilities. The type of instrument and pitch 
            at which the note is played in the music determines the shape and color of the visuals that are 
            displayed. Drawing from color psychology, different beats and rhythms in the musical composition 
            directly connected to varying levels of hue, value, and saturation of the colors. Simple shapes 
            and colors are used in alignment with the art of abstraction.
